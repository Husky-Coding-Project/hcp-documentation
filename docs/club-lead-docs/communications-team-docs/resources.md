# Communications Resources

## Social Media

Communications Team is responsible for our club Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Canva,
HCP Gmail, HCP UW Email, and LinkTree. To gain access to login information, see **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oc6wzgpeSDHapmO-W30hSg2c2Z3ES9yyr5oIIxh20U8/edit#)**. Only HCP Leads can open this.

If you cannot open this, then you have not been added to the HCP Leadership folder.
Contact your Co-Chairs for access.

## Post Tracker/RSO Tracker

This sheet covers the frequency of posts throughout the year (we post an average of 5 posts per quarter, every other week), and the content covered in these posts. These posts are more or less for events, announcements of important general meetings, or new updates on club leadership.

The **[RSO Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uAz-xaj3CED6NNkNwxgihwAROHDbkxf-dQjVvxB2qec/edit#gid=930254994)** includes:
- A checklist of what/when to post
- Mass email list

Please update the Post Tracker when new posts ideas and templates arise.
