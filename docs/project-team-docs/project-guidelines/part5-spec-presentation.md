# Part 5: Club-wide Spec Presentation

Now that you’ve finished planning your project and completed your spec, it’s time to present your product specification to the club! The purpose of a club-wide spec presentation is to inform your fellow club members about what your team is hoping to accomplish with your project and to receive feedback on what your team may have overlooked and what they can improve upon.

You will give a 5-10 minute high-level presentation about your project. During that time, you should cover the details presented in your spec along with a visual representation (Figma) of your project. Through this presentation, other club members will know what your team is working on and will have the opportunity to ask questions if needed.

- **Requirements of the spec**: an executive summary, problem statement, goals, MVP scope, Figma, languages, and technologies to be used
- **Main points to cover in your presentation**: problem statement, goals, MVP scope, high-level project team structure, potential tech stack, and Figma. You can glaze over the project team breakdown and languages and technologies to be used unless your project specifically wants feedback on that.
- You want to present enough information about your project such that everyone knows what problem you are trying to solve and how you plan to do that with your project

Once you give your presentation, club members will be asking questions about the project, request clarification on project details, and will give feedback on different aspects that can be improved. We recommend that your team take this in stride, build upon it, and keep an open mind to any feedback given.
